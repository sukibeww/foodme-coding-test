# FoodMe Coding Challange 

The challange is to recreate a section from the landing page from the provided prototype, while maintaining its responsiveness. 

Components:
- Responsive appbar 
- Image backdrop 
- Responsive carousel 


### Desktop prototype

### Mobile prototype

# Justifications 

### Font Inaccuracy 
Based on the prototype the font "PP Agrandir" is used on all of the relevant components. Since this is a premium font, I had to find a free alternative for it and I have decided that "Passion One, cursive" with a 400 font weight is a viable alternative. 

### Image asset innaccuracy
The current images that are being used are not the same as the prototype. The current images are extracted from the provided prototype through screenshot that I found quite similar or "Accurate enough" to replace the prototype. 

# Result

Thank you for allowing me to participate in this coding challange, It was a fun test that helped me to refresh my knowledge on React and MaterialUI. 
I hope that you find my work satisfactory.
